# ComfyUI-Geeky-LatentSyncWrapper 1.5

Unofficial enhanced fork of [LatentSync 1.5](https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync) implementation for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) on Windows and WSL 2.0.

This node provides advanced lip-sync capabilities in ComfyUI using ByteDance's LatentSync 1.5 model. It allows you to synchronize video lips with audio input with improved temporal consistency and better performance on a wider range of languages. This fork adds support for both single images and batch image processing.

## What's new in this fork?

1. **Single Image Support**: Process individual images with LatentSync
2. **Batch Image Processing**: Process multiple images in a batch for efficient workflows
3. **All original LatentSync 1.5 features**: Enhanced temporal consistency, better language support, and reduced VRAM requirements

## Original LatentSync 1.5 Features

1. **Temporal Layer Improvements**: Corrected implementation now provides significantly improved temporal consistency compared to version 1.0
2. **Better Chinese Language Support**: Performance on Chinese videos is now substantially improved through additional training data
3. **Reduced VRAM Requirements**: Now only requires 20GB VRAM (can run on RTX 3090) through various optimizations:
   - Gradient checkpointing in U-Net, VAE, SyncNet and VideoMAE
   - Native PyTorch FlashAttention-2 implementation (no xFormers dependency)
   - More efficient CUDA cache management
   - Focused training of temporal and audio cross-attention layers only
4. **Code Optimizations**:
   - Removed dependencies on xFormers and Triton
   - Upgraded to diffusers 0.32.2

## Prerequisites

Before installing this node, you must install the following in order:

1. [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) installed and working

2. FFmpeg installed on your system:
   - Windows: Download from [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) and add to system PATH

## Installation

Only proceed with installation after confirming all prerequisites are installed and working.

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/GeekyGhost/ComfyUI-Geeky-LatentSyncWrapper.git
cd ComfyUI-Geeky-LatentSyncWrapper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Required Dependencies
```
diffusers>=0.32.2
transformers
huggingface-hub
omegaconf
einops
opencv-python
mediapipe
face-alignment
decord
ffmpeg-python
safetensors
soundfile
```

## Note on Model Downloads

On first use, the node will automatically download required model files from HuggingFace:
- LatentSync 1.5 UNet model
- Whisper model for audio processing
- You can also manually download the models from HuggingFace repo: https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/LatentSync-1.5

### Checkpoint Directory Structure

After successful installation and model download, your checkpoint directory structure should look like this:

```
./checkpoints/
|-- .cache/
|-- auxiliary/
|-- whisper/
|   `-- tiny.pt
|-- config.json
|-- latentsync_unet.pt  (~5GB)
|-- stable_syncnet.pt   (~1.6GB)
```

Make sure all these files are present for proper functionality. The main model files are:
- `latentsync_unet.pt`: The primary LatentSync 1.5 model
- `stable_syncnet.pt`: The SyncNet model for lip-sync supervision
- `whisper/tiny.pt`: The Whisper model for audio processing

## Usage

### For Videos:
1. Select an input video file with AceNodes video loader
2. Load an audio file using ComfyUI audio loader
3. (Optional) Set a seed value for reproducible results
4. (Optional) Adjust the lips_expression parameter to control lip movement intensity
5. (Optional) Modify the inference_steps parameter to balance quality and speed
6. Connect to the LatentSync1.5 node
7. Run the workflow

### For Single Images:
1. Load a single image using ComfyUI's image loader
2. Load an audio file using ComfyUI audio loader
3. Connect to the LatentSync1.5 node with the single image mode enabled
4. Adjust parameters as needed
5. Run the workflow

### For Batch Images:
1. Load multiple images using ComfyUI's batch image loader or image list to batch node
2. Load an audio file using ComfyUI audio loader
3. Connect to the LatentSync1.5 node with the batch processing mode enabled
4. Adjust parameters as needed
5. Run the workflow

The processed video or images will be saved in ComfyUI's output directory.

### Node Parameters:
- `input_type`: Select between video, single image, or batch images
- `video_path`: Path to input video file (for video mode)
- `image`: Input single image (for single image mode)
- `image_batch`: Input batch of images (for batch image mode)
- `audio`: Audio input from ComfyUI audio loader
- `seed`: Random seed for reproducible results (default: 1247)
- `lips_expression`: Controls the expressiveness of lip movements (default: 1.5)
  - Higher values (2.0-3.0): More pronounced lip movements, better for expressive speech
  - Lower values (1.0-1.5): Subtler lip movements, better for calm speech
  - This parameter affects the model's guidance scale, balancing between natural movement and lip sync accuracy
- `inference_steps`: Number of denoising steps during inference (default: 20)
  - Higher values (30-50): Better quality results but slower processing
  - Lower values (10-15): Faster processing but potentially lower quality
  - The default of 20 usually provides a good balance between quality and speed
- `batch_size`: Number of images to process at once in batch mode (default: 4)
  - Higher values may require more VRAM

### Tips for Better Results:
- For speeches or presentations where clear lip movements are important, try increasing the lips_expression value to 2.0-2.5
- For casual conversations, the default value of 1.5 usually works well
- If lip movements appear unnatural or exaggerated, try lowering the lips_expression value
- Different values may work better for different languages and speech patterns
- If you need higher quality results and have time to wait, increase inference_steps to 30-50
- For quicker previews or less critical applications, reduce inference_steps to 10-15
- When processing batch images, adjust batch_size based on your available VRAM

## Known Limitations

- Works best with clear, frontal face images/videos
- Currently does not support anime/cartoon faces
- Video should be at 25 FPS (will be automatically converted)
- Face should be visible throughout the image/video
- Batch processing may require significant VRAM depending on batch size
